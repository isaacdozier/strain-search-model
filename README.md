# strain-search-model
A model for searching and displaying strains from producers and retailers.

This data model uses retailers, producers and lot numbers (a unique identifier for each plant) 
to track data over time for a given strain. 

Each harvest is given a 16 digit unique LOT# as an identifier per tracking guidelines.
